## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run the `.cpp` files found in these directories, you will need a C++ compiler such as:
* GCC/G++ (MinGW for Windows or native on Linux/macOS)
* Clang
* Visual Studio Code with the C/C++ extension

### Compilation
You can compile any of the source files using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o solution main.cpp
./solution
